# Source Control

Okay it doesn't really make a ton of sense to put a tutorial on source control, but you can clone this repository to see how it works (commit history and all).

I will probably be putting future tutorials in this organization so that they can all be found in the same place, and possibly past ones as well, because they're currently on MediaFire and that's pretty clunky.
